    doesnt is feel incredibly coincidental that we live at the very precipice of an intelligence explosion? 

why simulations?

    notes from bostrom

    (i actually dont have good answers)


    compare suns energy vs what it takes to run a simulation in an llm right now

        compare power efficeny trendss




why simulate us now tho?

    notes from article

    notes from video

    "we humans" are not the focus

        the simulation is for the evolution of intelligence. it transcends biology and perhaps even physics of our world. 

        definiting intelligence is hard. but good proxy is deliberate computation -> action in the world

    high variance worlds

    rsi seems like a process that varies a lot with slightly differnt nudges during takeoff time. so takeoff time needs to be samplede more

        why is rsi like that?

    (in these, i need to frame things in terms of intelligence, not humans)

    compare tech progress againt amount of humans

    compare speed of information exchange w time

        kurzweil

        ai allows bigger ideas faster

        how the intelligence is upgrading itself


    compare amount of energy harnessed

    compare amount of physical matter moved

    industrial revolution kicked off rsi

        emphasize how recent technological discovery is

            we didnt know cells existed

            electricity

            computing as a concept

            etc

    ai rsi

    absurdity of ai

        digital minds from sand (that tsmc article?)

        deep learning works is so weird

            we are not much more than simple algorithms over our sensory data?

        llms works is so weird

            human language has been the medium of gettings things done in the world. 
            efftively in the erra of ideas -> can do things in physical word 

            ai accelerates that or makes accerleration invetiable?

    eerie how we're already simulating stuff

        llms simulate personas

        genie, simulates phsycis of the world

        etc

its so high variance
