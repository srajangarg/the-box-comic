    doesnt is feel incredibly coincidental that we live at the very precipice of an intelligence explosion? 

why simulations?

    notes from bostrom

    (i actually dont have good answers)


    compare suns energy vs what it takes to run a simulation in an llm right now

        compare power efficeny trendss




    eerie how we're already simulating stuff

        llms simulate personas

        genie, simulates phsycis of the world

        etc
        

why simulate us now tho?

    notes from article

    notes from video

    "we humans" are not the focus

        the simulation is for the evolution of intelligence. it transcends biology and perhaps even physics of our world. 

        definiting intelligence is hard. but good proxy is deliberate computation -> action in the world

    high variance worlds

    rsi seems like a process that varies a lot with slightly differnt nudges during takeoff time. so takeoff time needs to be samplede more

        why is rsi like that?

    we live in crazy times, things are exponential

        human gdp meme
            but its anthropogenci and can be goodharted, it doesnt really mene anything

        ok lets look at morefundamental things
            compare amount of energy harnessed
                - entropy

            compare amount of physical matter moved

        now lets look at recent tech

            compare speed of information exchange w time
            internet speed
            memory, processing power, internet bandwidth
            kurzweil's points


    we live in crazy times, look how far we've come
        some reminders of how FAST we are moving and how NEW everything is
            we didnt know cells existed / vital life
            germs
            electricity
            computing as a concept
            imagine bringing a man from ... to ...

        at the cutting edge
            deeplearning was figured out 10 years ago
            llms came about 3 years ago
            digital minds from sand (that tsmc article?)
            IMO math problems, speculation on massive job loss


    there's explanations for why they're exponential
        RECURSIVE SELF IMPROVEMENT -- chalmer's thesis?

        birth of scientific method / industrial revolution kicked off rsi
            the takeoff started in 1600s. no it started when the printing press
            no it started with language, no it started with 
            the entire history of the unvierse feels like an exercise in this improvement
                what improvement -- something entropy related? how do we define intelligence??

        kurzweil's accelerating returns

        bostrom's inevitability

        yud's explosion


    there's evidence right now in front of your eyes, why it will stay exponential

        (maybe borrow from absurdity chapter for dramatic effect?)

        AI RSI is so close

     


this arguemnt explains

    fermi paradox

    

its so high variance
    my weakest argument, imo, because it can be argued that we've been in very high variance scenarios in the past as well
        counter: the high-variance is just startingn off?
        counter: the prev high variance was important in defining current world state (e.g. we could have reached faster if stuck to nuclear)

    ai experts disagreement

    warnings from ai experets  + lack of ai safety resear

    geo political instability

    race dyanmics in buuilding agi (takeoff step to intelligence explosion)


    hypercapitalism + informaiton markets



fiction: what happens once humanity realizes and proves we are in a simualtion?
