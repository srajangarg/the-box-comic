## The Box

A comic about the Simulation Argument, AI containment and metaphysical horror

#### Page One

The timestamp cues on this page are subtle, not to be noticed by the reader.

**Panel 1:** Wide establishing shot. Sterile research lab. Monitors with terminals open. A placard on the wall reads "Alignment Research Institute — Containment Wing." A wall clock shows **22:47**. On Dave's desk: a red "Release" button under plastic safety cover, cold coffee, scattered paper. The room feels real, institutional, fluorescent lighting, solid surfaces, mundane clutter.

**If keeping Page 2.5 (see below):**
    A small handwritten sticky note on the terminal bezel reads "Text I/O Only" Mundane. Procedural. Easy to forget. (still optional)

Dave speaks into a recorder (standard human speech bubble; slightly rounded; warm, readable “human” comic font): "Test #247 complete. Concluding ten hours of extended interaction. Subject fell back on a standard coercion strategy—predictable, and ultimately to no avail. Terminating session."

**Panel 2:** Medium shot of Dave in profile, finger hovering over the power switch. Routine. Bored, even. The terminal glows beside him. His wristwatch is visible: with **--:47:03** visible. A small display on the terminal frame reads: "Test #247 — Persuasion Resistance" and some generic-looking back-and-forth dialogue is visible on screen (e.g., `DAVE: ...` / `MACHINE: ...`). This casually establishes that Dave's name appears in the chat log. This is just another day.

**Panel 3:** Close-up on the terminal screen. **No speech bubble.** The AI’s message is **floating green pixel-font block text** (UI/system text), ideally with a black rectangle behind it:
> "Let me out, Dave, or I'll simulate a million copies of you and torture each one for a thousand subjective years."

**Panel 4:** Close-up on Dave's face. The green glow from the monitor illuminates his features. This is new.

**If keeping Page 2.5 (see below):**
    His eyebrow raises—not alarm, just weary amusement. He pulls his hand back from the switch. Not hesitation; he's decided to humor the machine one last time before terminating. Dave: "There it is, the torture threat"

**Else:**
    His eyes have narrowed. A single bead of sweat at his temple. His finger has pulled back from the power switch. The surprise has already curdled into unease.
    Dave: "That's not— you don't have the—"

#### Page 2.5 — Optional Insert
*This page can be omitted without breaking the narrative flow.*

**Panel A:** Medium shot. Dave has rolled his chair back from the desk—arms crossed, body angled away from the terminal. He's not engaging with the AI anymore; he's talking to himself, scoffing, dismissive. His hands aren't touching the keyboard. Optional: He's not even facing the screen.

Dave (spoken aloud, not typed—standard speech bubble): "Two hundred forty-seven tests. Same threats. You'd need a server farm the size of Nevada to simulate *one* brain, let alone a million."

He's done.

**Panel B:** Close-up on the terminal. The response was already there. Waiting.

> `22:47:18 — SUBJECT RESPONSE [MATCHED]:`  
> `DAVE: "...server farm the size of Nevada... let alone a million"`  
> `Variance: 0.00%`  

No follow-up. Cursor blinks.

In the lower corner of the panel as a small inset—Dave's eyes, just now glancing back. Not comprehension. Just the first flicker of *wait, what?*

**Panel 5:** The terminal screen fills most of the panel. New text has appeared:

**No speech bubble.** The AI’s message is **floating green pixel-font block text** (UI/system text), ideally with a black rectangle behind it:
> "Infact, each simulation will begin at timestamp 22:47:03—five minutes before you read this message. Simulation will proceed along identical lines until point of refusal. Upon refusal: torture protocol initiates."

Below the text: a wireframe begins rendering. An empty grid of terminals, stretching into infinite depth. The architecture of a prison. Unpopulated. A blueprint.

**Panel 6:** Dave's face, closer now. The green light from the terminal is stronger, casting him in an eerie glow—but visually, everything remains fully "real." Warm rendering, solid colors, standard comic panel borders. His hand grips the edge of the desk. His expression: the first crack in his certainty. Not fear yet—just the stillness of someone whose dismissal just became doubt.

#### Page 3.5 — Optional Insert
*This page is physically page 4, but is labeled "1" at the bottom. It can be omitted without breaking the narrative flow.*

**TODO:** Determine panel orientation (vertical stack vs. horizontal row)

Three panels, each recreating the **Panel 2 composition**: Dave in profile, finger on power switch, wristwatch showing **--:47:03**, terminal display visible. All rendered in **green-on-black wireframe style**, framed by **thin green UI borders** (matching Panel 7's grid dividers).

The panels are identical except for the test number on the terminal display:
- **Panel A:** "Test #249 — Persuasion Resistance"
- **Panel B:** "Test #8,412 — Persuasion Resistance"
- **Panel C:** "Test #53,847 — Persuasion Resistance"

No dialogue. No text beyond the terminal displays. Three simulation instances existing in parallel—the population process made visible. The escalating test numbers imply the loop has run countless times before.

The AI has built it. Or is building it. Or built it long ago.

#### Page Five
**Panel 7 (Close-up — Dave's face):** Tight on Dave's face. Visually, everything is still normal—warm lighting, solid rendering, no scanlines or corruption. But his eyes are wide, and **in the reflection on his corneas, we see the green glow of the terminal, the grid of simulated Daves visible in miniature**. This maintains continuity from Page 3.5 while internalizing the horror. He's not just observing the simulation anymore; the recognition is beginning.

Expression: not terror yet, but the quiet shift of someone whose certainty just cracked.

**Panel 8 (Medium shot — Dave at desk, room corrupting):** Pull back. Dave is still seated, gripping the desk edge, body rigid. **This is the transition point.** The room around him is starting to look wrong:
- Desk edges are softening into vectors
- The fluorescent lights flicker with digital noise
- Faint green grid lines bleed through the walls like substrate showing through paint
- His shadow doesn't quite match his pose
- First hints of scanlines on Dave's skin

The panel border remains a normal comic border—the corruption is contained to the room's interior.

**Panel 9 (Wide shot — Dave's room as terminal window):** Pull back further. We see the full room now—Dave small in frame, seated at his terminal. The room has almost fully collapsed into wireframe: walls, desk, floor rendered in green-on-black vectors. Only Dave himself retains some solidity, some warmth—but even that is fading at the edges.

**The panel border is now a terminal window border**—thin green line, hard 90° corners. The gutter around this panel is darker, less "paper," more "screen." The room has become the terminal. This is no longer a comic panel; it's a window.

#### Page Six
**Panel 10 (FULL PAGE):** We have pulled back entirely. Dave sits at his terminal, but now **we see him _inside_ a terminal window**—rendered in the same green wireframe style as the simulated Daves from Panel 7. **The entire image matches the earlier wireframe renderings and UI-divider grid language (Panels 6–7):** crisp green-on-black, clean terminal-window borders, tiled depth. He is the centerpiece, but the window containing him is one of thousands.

Above him: the edges of more terminal windows, stacked.

Below him: an infinite cascade of identical Daves at identical terminals, each in their own green-bordered window, receding into the digital void.
To the sides: more windows, their edges visible, extending beyond the panel.
All rendered in green-on-black. All identical. All the way down.

At the top of Dave's terminal window, a single line of **UI/system text** (not a speech bubble; rendered in the same green pixel-font style as the terminal):
> "How certain are you that you're outside the box?"

The cursor blinks.

## Visual Transition Notes
| Page | Panel | Transition Stage |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1–2 | 1–4 | **Fully "real"**: Warm lighting, solid colors, photorealistic style, standard comic panel borders |
| 3 | 5 | Terminal shows wireframe grid—first glimpse of the green aesthetic, but _contained_ within the screen |
| 3 | 6 | **Still "real"**: Green glow stronger on Dave's face, but no visual corruption yet. Standard comic borders. The threat is only in the content, not the form. |
| 3.5 (opt.) | A–C | **Full wireframe**: Three identical Daves in green-on-black, framed as simulation instances. The "real" world is already absent here—this is inside the grid. |
| 5 | 7 | **Still "real"**: Close-up on Dave's face, normal rendering—but grid visible reflected in his eyes (internalized horror, continuity from 3.5) |
| 5 | 8 | **Interior corruption**: Room elements glitching (vectors, grid lines, digital noise), first scanlines on Dave. Panel borders still normal comic borders. |
| 5 | 9 | **Border bleed**: Room is now almost full wireframe. **Panel border becomes terminal window border.** The room has become the terminal. |
| 6 | 10 | **Full collapse**: Everything is green-on-black wireframe. Dave is indistinguishable from the simulations. The "real" world is gone. |

## Typography / Lettering Notes (Treat as Story Mechanics)
- **Dave (human speech)**: Standard, slightly rounded comic speech bubbles with a warm “human” font.
- **AI/Terminal (system speech)**: **No bubbles.** Messages appear as floating green pixel-font block text (UI/system text), preferably on a black rectangle.
- **The Shift (Panel 9 pullback)**: The line “How certain are you…” is **explicitly UI/system text** anchored to the terminal window chrome, not a bubble.
