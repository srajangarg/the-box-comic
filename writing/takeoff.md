## anachronism / look how far we've come


we have existed as homo sapiens for the past X years.
our biological brains have remained roughly for the duration

out of that <long time>, it was only 


writing is only about ~5000 years old. for the rest of the ~295,000 years, all cultures and all information spread essentially orally. all our knowledge was transmitted in ephemeral vibrations in the air. the fact that squiggles on paper can be used to encode the sounds we made took us ... every story, every piece of knowledge, every instruction had to live in someone's memory or disappear forever.

the printing press is only ~600 years old.

the scientific method itself is only ~500 years old, shockingly recent. arguably, the single biggest point of inflection in humanity's technological trajectory?


the cell wasn't recognized as the fundamental unit of like unitl only ~200 years ago. in our typical anthromorphic thinking, we believed that humans possesnsed a vital "essence" needed for life

> time travel was not a common feature of fiction until the 19th century. this arises from the fact that time flowed differently for the past generations. present, for them, was just a continuation of the past - and the window in which things remained relatively "stable" hadn't shrunk as much as it has now. the implication of going to the future didn't have the consequences attached to it has today (we now know how fast science and social progress move and can project the slope into the future compared to forecasting the almost-zero slope line in the past). nostalgia existed, but were concerned only with the past-ness of the occurence, not because of being set in a drastically different and irretrievable world.

our breakthroughs and understanding of the universe seems to keep getting better and better

i feel like our human brains are anachronistic in current technology landscape. they were amazing bootstrappable machines ....

and now we're at the the precipice of the last invention... we are close to conquering what made it all possible

this thread on twitter showing anachronisms strike me as perfectly capturing the pace of our technological progress. things have mode so fast that they can now exist in the same image / same lifespan https://x.com/LinkofSunshine/status/1981850981181821347


the internet, smartphones and attention markets... laid the foundation for our next project, artificial general intelligence


deep learning became successful about ~15, transformers ~8 years ago, the scaling laws are bearing fruit in the last 3 years

and i believe we are not going to stop now.

## we're going exponential/hyperbolic

if you think any of this progress is normal and that the future is ...
i dont think you understand exponentials. this is how i see you:

## there's a plausible explanation for ...

far too difficult to predict. if
