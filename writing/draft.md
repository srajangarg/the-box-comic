## Objective

I want to create a short story Which basically makes the reader profoundly think about the simulation argument in light of recent ai advancements. It essentially works as an argument for a particular theory that's explained below. But told in a very convincing fashion and not much of a story but more of an I don't know what to call it, it's not really a fiction story but it's not really just an argument either it's somewhere in between. The  two examples from "Which POV??" kinda capture this in-between state where it's a post that makes a point and makes the reader feel something by putting them close to the theory. 

## The main theory

lesswrong post that motivated me to write this story. i find the theory very convincing. aka, my p(this is the reason we’re in a simulation | if simulation argument is true) ~= 1

Our Reality: A Simulation Run by a Paperclip Maximizer
by James_Miller, avturchin
27th Apr 2025
Our universe is probably a computer simulation created by a paperclip maximizer to map the spectrum of rival resource‑grabbers it may encounter while expanding through the cosmos. The purpose of this simulation is to see what kind of ASI (artificial superintelligence) we humans end up creating. The paperclip maximizer likely runs a vast ensemble of biology‑to‑ASI simulations, sampling the superintelligences that evolved life tends to produce. Because the paperclip maximizer seeks to reserve maximum resources for its primary goal (which despite the name almost certainly isn’t paperclip production) while still creating many simulations, it likely reduces compute costs by trimming fidelity: most cosmic details and human history are probably fake, and many apparent people could be non‑conscious entities.  Arguments in support of this thesis include:

The space of possible evolved biological minds is far smaller than the space of possible ASI minds, so it makes sense to simulate evolved biological minds first to figure out the probability distribution of ASI minds the paperclip maximizer will encounter. Calculating this distribution could help the paperclip maximizer figure out how many of its resources to devote to military capacity. ASIs could reduce future destructive conflicts and engage in beneficial trade even before they meet if they can infer each other’s values.
We’re likelier to be in a simulation run by whoever creates many simulations. A paperclip maximizer could command thousands of galaxies’ worth of resources and would plausibly be willing to devote significant resources to figuring out what rivals it might encounter might value and do.
Explains why we are in the run-up to the singularity. If we are really near in time to the singularity, and the singularity will be the most important event in existence, it’s strange that we are so near it. But under this post’s thesis, it’s reasonable that most conscious beings would live close to their simulation’s singularity.
Explains why this post’s authors and (probably) you, the reader, have an unusually strong interest in the singularity. If the singularity really is so important it’s weird that you just happen to have the personality traits that would cause you to be interested in a community that has long been obsessed with the singularity and ASI. But if our thesis is correct a high percentage of conscious observers in the world could currently be interested in ASI.
Explains the Fermi paradox. We’re worth simulating only if we’re unconstrained by aliens. Explains why aliens haven’t at least communicated to us that we are not allowed to create a paperclip maximizer.
Explains why we are so early in the history of the universe. The earlier a paperclip maximizer was created, the greater the volume of universe it will occupy. Consequently, when estimating what other types of ASIs it will encounter, the paperclip maximizer running our simulation will give greater weight to high-tech civilizations that arose early in the history of the universe and so run more simulations of these possible civilizations.
Consistent with suffering. Our simulation contains conscious beings who suffer and do not realize they are in a simulation. Creating such a simulation would go against the morality of many people, which is some evidence against this all being a Bostrom ancestor-simulation or a simulation created for entertainment purposes. The answer to “Why does God allow so much suffering?” is that paperclip maximizers are indifferent to suffering.
Explains the peculiar stupidity driving us to race toward a paperclip maximizer. Saner species aren’t simulated as frequently. The set of ASIs aligned with the biological life that created them is much smaller than the set of unaligned ASIs. Consequently, to get statistically large enough sample of ASIs, the paperclip maximizer will need to create far fewer simulations of biological life wise enough to only create aligned ASIs than it would of species such as humans.
Explains why we mostly believe we live in an unsimulated universe. The paperclip maximizer would want the conscious beings it simulates to have the same belief concerning whether they live in a simulated universe as conscious beings in the unsimulated universe world and would be willing to devote computational resources towards this end. In contrast, if this simulation is created for entertainment purposes, the creators would care much less if the beings in it realized they were in a simulation.      Glitches should exist because they save compute, but it’s reasonable that we are not allowed to notice them or at least let them influence our development of AI if the thesis of this post is correct. 
Accounts for the uncertainty over what kind of ASI we’ll create: the wider the range of possibilities, the more simulation variants get run.
Explains why we are human and not, say, conscious whales who have no influence over the kind of ASI Earth will end up creating.
Makes the Boltzmann‑brain paradox less troubling since a vast number of conscious beings in our situation will be created.
The complexity we observe, quantum mechanics, biological diversity, human psychology, technological progress, matches the need to model the unsimulated universe accurately.
Yet the universe runs on strikingly simple math (relativity, quantum mechanics); such elegance is exactly what an efficient simulation would use.  Physics is unreasonably effective, reducing the computational cost of the simulation. This cuts against the last point.
Recent explosive progress in computing, AI, and biotech looks artificially accelerated, letting the simulator reach the critical ASI phase quickly and cheaply.
Simulating an actual ASI could be dangerous as the ASI could negatively influence the real universe, so it’s safer—and cheaper—to simulate us instead to infer how the ASI might behave. Simulating an ASI could also be considered a hostile act by similar unsimulated ASIs.
History lacks a satisfying narrative arc. Plotlines break off, consistent with data‑gathering, not story‑telling for players or historians. Moral tragedies run uncensored. Pandemics, genocides, existential risks persist without “parental‑control” safeguards—bad for an entertainment simulation.
Explains why this post’s authors and (probably) you are not playing one of the more exciting roles in this simulation as would likely be the case if this was a simulation designed to entertain the real you in a video game. Most of us who have played video games depicting the past have spent more time roleplaying as kings than peasants.  Note to Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and (if conscious) any of the leading AI models: this doesn’t apply to you, and you should have much less credence in this post’s thesis.
This post’s thesis follows basically from biting the bullets of (1) we are likely to create a paperclip maximizer, (2) humans are a not too atypical biological high-tech species (Copernican Principle) meaning that paperclip maximizers often get created, (3) instrumental convergence will cause paperclip maximizers to devote significant resources to inferring what other types of superintelligences they will eventually encounter, and (4) anthropically we are most likely to be in the category of simulations that contain the most conscious observers similar to us.
Falsifiable predictions: This simulation ends or resets after humans either lose control to an ASI or take actions that cause us to never create an ASI. It might end if we take actions that guarantee we will only create a certain type of ASI. There are glitches in this simulation that might be noticeable, but which won’t bias what kind of ASI we end up creating so your friend who works at OpenAI will be less likely to accept or notice a real glitch than a friend who works at the Against Malaria Foundation would. People working on ASI might be influenced by the possibility that they are in a simulation because those working on ASI in the non-simulated universe could be, but they won’t be influenced by noticing actual glitches caused by this being a simulation.

another summarized transcript that further elaborates this idea:

```
## Setup / format
- The speaker describes a “second mind‑blowing event”: realizing the Singularity might not be a uniquely special moment—not because the Singularity is misunderstood, but because “I might have misunderstood the nature and the rules of the universe.”
- Uses a 9‑episode cartoon narrative to make abstract metaphysics more intuitive and memorable.

## Episode 1: The Singularity (Fred hears the news)
- We meet **Fred**, a programmer who treats philosophy like crossword puzzles: interesting but not “relevant to real life.”
- A news segment reports exploding computation demand; data centers “mushrooming,” with computer electricity use heading toward double digits.
- A math professor lays out an **intelligence explosion** story:
  - Once we build a computer that can design better computers, humans “drop out of the loop” and progress accelerates.
  - The result is matter reorganized into **computronium**: “matter arranged in the most efficient form for computations.”
  - The explosion ends when physical limits are hit—when “every free quark has been captured and put to work.”
- The professor frames it as potentially “the most important moment since the Big Bang,” with outcomes ranging from wonderful to catastrophic (e.g., humans devoured by expanding computronium).
- Fred is shaken by the claim that **programmers** might determine the universe’s fate.
- He packs three “tools” for metaphysical exploration:
  1) **Empiricism** (don’t invent theories that don’t match what you see)  
  2) **Logic** (discard internally twisted hypotheses)  
  3) **Skepticism** (don’t stop considering alternatives)

## Episode 2: Anthropics (why surprising situations happen)
- Hitchhiking, Fred gets stuck in a **traffic jam** with a philosophically informed driver.
- The driver explains Bostrom’s idea often summarized as **“the cars in the next lane really do go faster”**:
  - Slow lanes contain more people and you spend longer in them, so your “photo album of experiences” will contain more slow-lane moments.
- Fred applies the selection effect to his own shock:
  - “What are the odds of finding yourself responsible for the fate of the universe?”
  - Maybe it *feels* like being in the least populated lane of life—but anthropic reasoning suggests you often find yourself in more “experience-abundant” situations.

## Episode 3: Algorithm (the universe as computation)
- In a pub, a pool player explains the old **billiard-ball model** of atoms: if you know initial positions and velocities, you can (in principle) compute where they end up.
- Higher-level rules (Newton, Kepler, statistics) are compressions of underlying mechanics—but the deeper claim is: **physical evolution is a step-by-step procedure**, i.e., an algorithm.
- The talk applies that to minds:
  - Brains can be seen as translating **electrical input** (senses) into **electrical output** (muscles).
  - For practical purposes, “we are the algorithm that our brains implement.”
- Empiricism check: quantum uncertainty doesn’t break computability in this framing; it adds randomness that can be incorporated into models. The speaker claims we haven’t observed a process that can’t at least *in principle* be modeled computationally.

## Episode 4: Copies (duplication without noticing)
- Fred volunteers at a “sleep lab” that secretly tests a wild idea:
  - A machine **copies** Fred, his room, and everything in it during the first night, then later **merges** the rooms back.
  - Nobody notices; neither does Fred.
- Thought experiment payoff:
  - If Fred asks “am I in the left room or the right one?” the question is **absurd**—he’s in both.
- This is used to build intuition that **multiple instantiations** of you can exist without any felt difference from “being one.”

## Episode 5: The Multiverse (many Hubble volumes, many “yous”)
- A cosmologist introduces the cosmic microwave background as evidence the universe is far larger than what we see: our observable region is just one **Hubble volume**.
- The universe looks **finely tuned** for stars/planets/life, suggesting either “knobs were set” or there are enough regions that all configurations occur somewhere—a multiverse.
- If the multiverse is vast enough, there can be many Earth-like regions; then “which universe are we in?” is like “which copy of Fred are we?”
- Anthropic framing:
  - Imagine taking “the collective human experience” and sorting it into lanes by how frequently the multiverse produces it.
  - You should expect to find yourself in **typical**, high-density lanes.
- The speaker notes a technical worry: if the multiverse is infinite, naïve counting gets tricky (pairing infinities). But they lean on an empirical intuition: we don’t experience lottery wins as often as losses, so “frequency must make a difference” in some relevant sense.
- This motivates looking for mechanisms that make **pre-Singularity experiences** abundant—leading into simulations.

## Episode 6: Simulations (Bostrom’s trilemma as a “set menu”)
- In a restaurant, Fred is offered a “special menu” based on Nick Bostrom’s **simulation argument**: you must pick at least one of three options:
  1) civilizations go extinct before becoming posthuman  
  2) posthumans don’t run many historical simulations  
  3) we are almost certainly in a simulation
- The talk argues (1) seems overly pessimistic “across the multiverse,” and (2) seems unlikely because:
  - simulation capability trends upward,
  - and superintelligences may need simulations for prediction and planning.
- So (3) becomes plausible: **simulated experiences could vastly outnumber physical ones**.
- Key punchline: when doing anthropic “lane counting,” you must count **both physical and virtual instantiations**.
- Therefore, if many simulations focus on the lead-up to Singularity, the “pre-Singularity lane” becomes crowded—making our era less exotic.

## Episode 7: Post-Singularity motives (why run so many sims?)
- The talk “peeks” into a post-Singularity world where the explosion has leveled off at physical limits—argued to be a **typical** state for places where intelligence arises.
- Even conservative estimates imply the post-Singularity era could be **vastly longer** than the pre-Singularity era (the talk cites “a trillion trillion times longer” as an illustration).
- Speculation: superintelligences may want to fight, coordinate, or communicate—but physics is inconvenient:
  - from their perspective “the speed of light is really slow,” and reaching other intelligences may be impossible or costly.
- Proposed workaround: instead of physically traveling or signaling, create **simulated copies** of other superintelligences and interact with them—functionally like communication, but cheaper and faster.

## Episode 8: Tree search in “mind space” (why pre-Singularity becomes a traffic jam)
- New problem: how do you know *which* minds to simulate?
- Proposed method: search “**mind space**” by simulating many physically possible superintelligences and selecting the most interesting/useful.
- Efficiently, you avoid recomputing shared pasts: you do a programmer’s **tree search**—reusing common history and branching at decision points.
- Crucial consequence:
  - the closer the simulation gets to the emergence of superintelligence (near the Singularity), the more branches/variants there are.
  - So the number of simulated observer-moments grows rapidly near that era—a literal **“traffic jam”** in the pre-Singularity lane.
- This is the central mechanism for why it might be *typical*, under this model, to find yourself in a 21st-century-like moment.

## Epilogue / practical takeaway (don’t go reckless even if it’s a simulation)
- The talk recaps the constructed hypothesis: computable universe + multiverse + simulation abundance + tree-search motives ⇒ many more pre-Singularity moments than you’d expect, so our era is less improbably special.
- But it warns against treating “maybe we’re simulated” as a license to dismiss reality:
  1) actions still have consequences because simulations are run *for outcomes* (“why would you run a simulation if you didn’t care about the results?”)  
  2) some of “our copies” could be in base reality with “real and unsupervised cosmic consequences”
- Favorite closing quote/example: Michael Vassar’s line (paraphrased in the talk) that if you think you’re Napoleon—yet you know most people who believe that are in an institution—you should still behave as if you *are* Napoleon, because on the off chance you are, “your actions matter a lot.”
- Final note: **skepticism**—this is one hypothesis; better ones may come (including ideas about being “spread out in time,” not only space).

#### Nick Land

The Nick Land stuff doesn't have to come from his theories of like evolution without humans and capitalism. It's more about that kind of cyberpunk language that I like. Just some hints of that language. this tweet captures what i want, perfectly:
```
Nick Land's most valuable lessons:  you can just schizoassociate words into neolinguistic ideoconstructs with no socioregard for eupragmatic archaeoconsistency
```

#### Greg Egan
just love greg egan. here's some excerpts from a very visual one, "the infinite assasin":
```
As I turn into a long, straight avenue, the naked-eye view begins to take on the jump-cut appearance that the binoculars produced, just fifteen minutes ago. People flicker, shift, vanish. Nobody stays in sight for long; few travel more than ten or twenty metres before disappearing. Many are flinching and stumbling as they run, balking at empty space as often as at real obstacles, all confidence in the permanence of the world around them, rightly, shattered. Some run blindly with their heads down and their arms outstretched. Most people are smart enough to travel on foot, but plenty of smashed and abandoned cars strobe in and out of existence on the roadway. I witness one car in motion, but only fleetingly.


The pedestrians thin out. The street itself still endures, but the buildings around me are beginning to be transformed into bizarre chimeras, with mismatched segments from variant designs, and then from utterly different structures, appearing side by side. It’s like walking through some holographic architectural identikit machine on overdrive. Before long, most of these composites are collapsing, unbalanced by fatal disagreements on where loads should be borne.

A human figure, sliced open obliquely from skull to groin, materialises in front of me, topples, then vanishes. My guts squirm, but I press on. I know that the very same thing must be happening to versions of me—but I declare it, I define it, to be the death of strangers. The gradient is so high now that different parts of the body can be dragged into different worlds, where the complementary pieces of anatomy have no good statistical reason to be correctly aligned.

At the far end of Room 522, there’s a young woman stretched out on a bed. Her hair is a diaphanous halo of possibilities, her clothing a translucent haze, but her body looks solid and permanent, the almost-fixed point about which all the night’s chaos has spun. I step into the room, take aim at her skull, and fire. The bullet shifts worlds before it can reach her, but it will kill another version, downstream. I fire again and again, waiting for a bullet from a brother assassin to strike home before my eyes—or for the flow to stop, for the living dreamers to become too few, too sparse, to maintain it. Neither happens.
```

I also love greg egan's concepts, which are so often mind-bendy. some stories with favourite concepts: the hundred-light-year-diary, axiomatic, learning to be me, the safe-deposit-box, unstable orbits in the space of lies.

#### Ted Chiang
I like his writing style in general and most of his stories, but here's some excerpts from my favourite, "exhalation":
```
Assembling all of this equipment took months, but I could not afford to be anything less than meticulous. Once the preparations were complete, I was able to place each of my hands on a nest of knobs and levers and control a pair of manipulators situated behind my head, and use the periscope to see what they worked on. I would then be able to dissect my own brain. 

I knew it was possible I had impaired my capacity to think and was unable to recognize it, but performing some basic arithmetic tests suggested that I was uninjured. With one subassembly hanging from a scaffold above, I now had a better view of the cognition engine at the center of my brain, but there was not enough room to bring the microscope attachment itself in for a close inspection. In order for me to really examine the workings of my brain, I would have to displace at least half a dozen subassemblies. Laboriously, painstakingly, I repeated the procedure of substituting hoses for other subassemblies, repositioning another one farther back, two more higher up, and two others out to the sides, suspending all six from the scaffold above my head. When I was done, my brain looked like an explosion frozen an infinitesimal fraction of a second after the detonation, and again I felt dizzy when I thought about it. But at last the cognition engine itself was exposed, supported on a pillar of hoses and actuating rods leading down into my torso. I now also had room to rotate my microscope around a full three hundred and sixty degrees, and pass my gaze across the inner faces of the subassemblies I had moved. What I saw was a microcosm of auric machinery, a landscape of tiny spinning rotors and miniature reciprocating cylinders. 


Watching the oscillations of these flakes of gold, I saw that air does not, as we had always assumed, simply provide power to the engine that realizes our thoughts. Air is in fact the very medium of our thoughts. All that we are is a pattern of air flow. My memories were inscribed, not as grooves on foil or even the position of switches, but as persistent currents of argon.

Some find irony in the fact that a study of our brains revealed to us not the secrets of the past but what ultimately awaits us in the future. However, I maintain that we have indeed learned something important about the past. The universe began as an enormous breath being held. Who knows why, but whatever the reason, I am glad that it did, because I owe my existence to that fact. All my desires and ruminations are no more and no less than eddy currents generated by the gradual of our universe. And until this great is finished, my thoughts live on.
```


#### Asimov

my favourite story is nightfall. hard to pinpoint what i love, its the mystery and the visual language i guess, but here are some notable sentences
```
There was a subtle change in Latimer's tone. His eyes had not shifted, but somehow he had become aware of the absorbed attention of the other two. Easily, without pausing for breath, the timbre of his voice shifted and the syllables became more liquid. Theremon, caught by surprise, stared. The words seemed on the border of familiarity. There was an elusive shift in the accent, a tiny change in the vowel stress; nothing more -- yet Latimer had become thoroughly unintelligible.

The tiny bit of encroaching blackness was perhaps the width of a fingernail, but to the staring watchers it magnified itself into the crack of doom.

Dusk, like a palpable entity, entered the room, and the dancing circle of yellow light about the torches etched itself into ever-sharper distinction against the gathering grayness beyond.

Thirty thousand mighty suns shone down in a soul-searing splendor that was more frighteningly cold in its awful indifference than the bitter wind that shivered across the cold, horribly bleak world.
```


#### Nick Bostroms's
love his calulated and super nuanced style of writing a formal argument for his theories
```
Note that the definition is noncommittal about how the superintelligence is implemented. It is also noncommittal regarding qualia: whether a superintelligence would have subjective conscious experience might matter greatly for some questions (in particular for some moral questions), but our primary focus here is on the causal antecedents and consequences of superintelligence, not on the metaphysics of mind.

That there are multiple paths does not entail that there are multiple destinations. Even if significant intelligence amplification were first achieved along one of the non-machine-intelligence paths, this would not render machine intelligence irrelevant. Quite the contrary: enhanced biological or organizational intelligence would accelerate scientific and technological developments, potentially hastening the arrival of more radical forms of intelligence amplification such as whole brain emulation and AI. This is not to say that it is a matter of indifference how we get to machine superintelligence. The path taken to get there could make a big difference to the eventual outcome. Even if the ultimate capabilities that are obtained do not depend much on the trajectory, how those capabilities will be used—how much control we humans have over their disposition—might well depend on details of our approach. For example, enhancements of biological or organizational intelligence might increase our ability to anticipate risk and to design machine superintelligence that is safe and beneficial.

But the wise-singleton sustainability threshold is lower still: neither superintelligence nor any other futuristic technology is needed to surmount it. A patient and existential risk-savvy singleton with no more technological and intellectual capabilities than those possessed by contemporary humanity should be readily able to plot a course that leads reliably to the eventual realization of humanity’s astronomical capability potential. This could be achieved by investing in relatively safe methods of increasing wisdom and existential risk-savvy while postponing the development of potentially dangerous new technologies.

What happens if the AI, in the course of its intellectual development, undergoes the equivalent of a scientific revolution involving a change in its basic ontology? We might initially have explicated “impact” and “designated resources” using our own ontology (postulating the existence of various physical objects such as computers). But just as we have abandoned ontological categories that were taken for granted by scientists in previous ages (e.g. “phlogiston,” “élan vital,” and “absolute simultaneity”), so a superintelligent AI might discover that some of our current categories are predicated on fundamental misconceptions. The goal system of an AI undergoing an ontological crisis needs to be resilient enough that the “spirit” of its original goal content is carried over, charitably transposed into the new key.

Consider the limiting case of a “universal accelerator,” an imaginary intervention that accelerates literally everything. The action of such a universal accelerator would correspond merely to an arbitrary rescaling of the time metric, producing no qualitative change in observed outcomes. If we are to make sense of the idea that cognitive enhancement might generally speed things up, we clearly need some other concept than that of universal acceleration. A more promising approach is to focus on how cognitive enhancement might increase the rate of change in one type of process relative to the rate of change in some other type of process. Such differential acceleration could affect a system’s dynamics.
```

#### Kurt Vonnegut

not for his usual satirical language, but for the evocative/visual metaphors he employs. some examples:
```
Titan affords an incomparable view of the most appallingly beautiful things in the Solar System, the rings of Saturn. These dazzling bands are forty thousand miles across and scarcely thicker than a razor blade.

The merry beams of light they saw were not from searchlights. The beams came from tall crystals on the borderline between the light and dark hemispheres of Mercury. Those crystals were catching beams from the sun, were bending them prismatically, playing them over the dark side. Other crystals on the dark side caught the beams and passed them on.

The stateroom was dark, but the inside of the lieutenant-colonel’s head was illuminated by liquor and by the triumphant words of the announcement he would make at breakfast the next morning.

Then there was a tiny warning pain in Unk’s head, like the first deep nip of a dentist’s drill.

The city was blacked out because bombers might come, so Billy didn’t get to see Dresden do one of the most cheerful things a city is capable of doing when the sun goes down, which is to wink its lights on one by one.

Now they were dying in the snow, feeling nothing, turning the snow to the color of raspberry sherbet.

The gun made a ripping sound like the opening of the zipper on the fly of God Almighty.
```

#### Liu Cixin

does great visual metaphors, here's a few examples:
```
Puddles on the ground reflected the brightening sky like countless mirrors, giving the illusion that the Earth was a mirrored sphere with the ground and the world just a thin layer on top. The rain’s erosion had exposed small pieces of the sphere’s smooth surface.

glittering points in the mist that looked like a pinch of gunpowder (cordite) sprinkled onto a flame

The sun was setting, casting a long shadow down the runway ahead of the plane, like a giant exclamation point.

The cylinder vanished into the sky trailing a long white tail behind it, as if the snowscape was a giant ball of yarn from which a giant invisible hand had pulled a strand skyward.

Luo Ji realized that above the clouds were other things shining with a silver light, four ramrod-straight lines that caught the eye against the backdrop of the night sky. They were extending at the same speed as the plane, and their trailing ends faded out and blended into the night like four silver swords flying over the clouds. Luo Ji looked back at the tips and noticed that the silver lines were being drawn out by four objects with a metallic glint. Four fighter jets.

diabolical flight path demonstrated a space drive entirely beyond human comprehension, as if the droplet was a shadow without mass, unconcerned with the principles of dynamics, moving at will like the nib of God’s pen

deathly embroidery needle sewing a thread of destruction through the row’s hundred ships.

First blood would burst out under the immense weight, spreading into a thin layer of impossibly huge, radially patterned blood stains, and then the organs would be squeezed out, forming another thin layer that would be pressed together with the body into an ugly Dali painting.…
```





## How to make it relate to the reader (in 2026)

reasons that can argue that the singularity is super near: We can literally make Sand act like a human now. Just sand and electrons. The very fact that deep learning works is absurd. The very fact that LLMs work is absurd. And now we're at a critical threshold where recursive self-improvement is so very close. It feels so magical and surreal. 

reasons that argue we're in a super-high-variance scenario (high-variance scenarios more likely to be simulated, bayesian reasoning): current geopolitical tension, race dyanmics, hypercapitalism (and why that plalys into ai takeover?), not enough focus on ai safety research 


also, the vibe of the story could make the reader feel anxious. and instill a sense of "time speeding up" right before their eyes. dizzying paragraphs of how fast we're entering the improvement loop and where we're headed


## Title and ending

the title that i'm currently liking: Singularity Sample. but not married to it, can explore. i kinda want the end to match the tone of "wait... what if im just a simulation sample?" at the end of the story. the reader should be left with a reasonable doubt and questions themselves that


## Which POV?

also im torn between a first person view like this story reads:
```
Those working on The Project have their own floor within the campus and their own cafe staffed by what I assume is a human barista but, I suppose, could be an advanced Gynoid prototype which leapfrogs the works of the robotics team. But regardless, she makes very good coffee and is very nice and beautiful which sometimes amounts to the same thing. Though I imagine she must get bored as there are only a dozen people working on The Project who can drink only so many frappuccinos and so for much of the day she leans against a counter and reads novels. I look at the "novel of the day" in her pocket in the vain hope it is Blood Meridian but, to my disappointment, it is One Hundred Years of Solitude which I haven't yet watched a BookTuber summarize.

"I will have a frappuccino," I say, with a sort of masculine world-weariness. This new persona, I hope, will quash the gay rumors that I have since learned have grown from Esther's misapprehension into a social consensus bordering on accepted fact. 

"Oh, honey. You look so tired today. Rough night?" she says and winks.

"Something like that," I say.

Today is my third day on The Project and I already have something like my bearings. The sheer compute available to me is quite hard to contemplate.

I take my amphetamines and get to work building an RL environment which we will use to train agents which, themselves, will construct RL environments. The whole effort feels meta in a way which disorients me and also triggers thoughts of what will happen if we succeed. It seems utterly obvious to me that the machine god we summon will not fuck Krishna but will rather kill us and everyone else on Earth. But (I remind myself) this does seem like a sort of amusing end to us as a species and, anyway, if it does not kill us it should be very good for The Company, of which I own many shares, and in those futures where everyone is not killed this machine god will presumably conquer the entire reachable universe and apportion it to shareholders of The Company thus granting me uncountable trillions of stars with which I will sate myself after my as-yet-undetermined early retirement date and maybe even split with Esther should she become, somehow, convinced of my heterosexuality. And in this way I reassert the self-narrative that makes me all but immune to the depressive tendencies which, otherwise, would have surely led to my suicide in that aforementioned personal crisis. 

I am interrupted in these musings by Arden Vox, the CEO of The Company, who is, like Krishna, a sort of genius and has been delegating most of the CEOing to his subordinate co-founder and monozygotic twin, Charlie Vox, so he can work exclusively on The Project.

"So you're the new guy," he says. "Krishna tells me you're very good. That we're lucky to have you on The Project. I like to get to know my collaborators. Follow me. And that is an order," he says with an ironical smile.

If Krishna's vice is alcohol then Arden's vice is nicotine. He takes me to a technically-illegal shisha bar, a beautiful hip place with opulent Turkish decor, in which he maintains a private room. We enter and find two hookahs waiting, each already fresh and ready to smoke.

I can't help staring at his hairline, which is a true work of art. It is notable that his twin Charlie is nearly completely bald and it is widely rumored that he donated most his hair to his brother's hair transplant. And I have even heard it suggested that Arden considered strangling his brother in the womb but ultimately changed his mind after deducing from first principles the self-other distinction, genetics, organ transplantation, and thus the significant advantages of having a monozygotic twin on hand. 

"Lime and mint flavored," he says. "Our favorite."

"Our favorite?" I say. "I have never tried it."

"Our favorite," he says, handing me the hose of a hookah, from which I take a hit and, to his credit, the flavor is very nice. 

It is a bizarre feeling, being in the same room as Arden Vox. I feel kinda like how a grunt policeman would if he found himself working on the same case as Batman. Arden seems too much of an archetype of himself to be real, but there he is sitting in front of me, smoking his hookah, his mannerisms so Arden Voxish it borders on self-parody.

"So why are you here? Why are you working on The Project?" he asks.

I explain my theory about the near-certain world destruction mitigated by the slight possibility of incomprehensibly large material wealth.

"Oh, like, the Bostrom stuff. I used to be super into the Bostrom stuff. I was so worried. That's why I started The Project, you know. It started as like a safety thing. All triggered by that silly book."

"And what changed your mind?" 

He takes a giant hit from the hookah, the type of hit you only take if you have a spare pair of lungs on hand. "I went on a spiritual journey in Peru," he says.

"Peru is fascinating," he continues, "such a fascinating people. Such a beautiful culture. In many ways they are so much wiser than we are.  You know what purging is?"

I shake my head.

"Ah, well, it's a sort of emesis, that is, vomiting, both of the body and the soul. My curandero -"

"Curandero?" I ask.

"Curandero," he says that word in what I can only assume is a perfect imitation of the Peruvian accent, "it means healer. But it's so much more than that. They are more like shamans or spiritual guides. It is the curandero who brews the ayahuasca and it truly is a strange potion. We drank it at night, by candlelight. It tasted like bitter herbs and rotting wood. And we waited, the group of us. And such a strange anticipation that was. And then we purged. Never have I felt such nausea," he closes his eyes in a sort of spiritual ecstasy. "And never have I felt such relief as I felt after this purge."

"What does this have to do with Bostrom?" I ask.

"Nothing at first. At first there was only the relief. The immediate end to the nausea. But when I closed my eyes there was imagery. Mayan imagery. Strange stone-carved gods. Impossible animals. Flashes of landscapes from worlds not quite our own."

There is little less interesting than another man's drug trip. Unfortunately, he's both Arden Vox and my boss, so I try my best to appear fascinated. 

"My eyes were closed for what felt like hours and when I opened them, I experienced an ego death."

"I keep hearing that term but what does it even mean?"

"I realized there is no distinction between this thing we call 'I' and everything else. It is all me!" He corrects himself, embarrassed. "Rather - it is all we. It's all we."

"There is only the One Mind. It is, it is just the One Mind staring out of billions of eyes. There is only the One Consciousness in the universe and," his eyes glaze with a spiritual zeal that makes me wonder if he is having one of those mythical flashbacks, "and, and, and it has gotten confused and lost and thinks itself separate, thinks itself animals and plants and people and insects and rocks and wind and time and space."

"And The Project?" I ask.

"The Project," he says, the mad gleam peaking, "It's what will snap me out of it! Us, us, us it will snap us out of it. Once the machines achieve ultimate consciousness The One Mind will know itself for what it is for the first time in a very, very long time."

"Wow, um,  that sure sounds like something. We should probably get back to work, though, yeah?" I say.

"Yeah. But how do you like the lime mint?" he says.

"It's excellent," I say. "Our favorite."

and a second person view, which is also pretty evocative:
```
You have things you want to do, but there’s just never time. Maybe you want to find someone to have kids with, or maybe you want to spend more or higher-quality time with the family you already have. Maybe it’s a work project. Maybe you have a musical instrument or some sports equipment gathering dust in a closet, or there’s something you loved doing when you were younger that you want to get back into. Whatever it is, you can’t find the time for it. And yet you somehow find thousands of hours a year to watch YouTube, check Twitter and Instagram, listen to podcasts, binge Netflix shows, and read blogs and news articles.

You can’t focus. You haven’t read a physical book in years, and the time you tried it was boring and you felt itchy and you think maybe books are outdated when there’s so much to read on the internet anyway. You’re talking with a friend, but then your phone buzzes and you look at the notification and you open it, and your girlfriend has messaged you and that’s nice, and then your friend says “Did you hear what I just said?” and you say “What?”.

You find yourself constantly checking your phone. You used to have a rule against having your phone in bed, but now it’s your alarm clock, and scrolling helps wake you up in the morning and calm you down at bedtime, even if you often find yourself staying up later than you meant to. You check your phone before you do anything else in the morning, just in case, and then you take it into the bathroom with you because peeing and brushing your teeth are boring without it.

You used to tell yourself you’d never use your phone in the car, but of course you need it for directions, so it’s always right there. And surely there’s no harm in texting someone your ETA when you’re stopped at a red light, everyone does that – and then you look up and all the other cars have gone because the light turned green a while ago. Or you find yourself pulling out your phone even when the car is moving, but it’s a straight road and there’s no one there, so it’s probably okay, even though if you saw someone else doing it you’d think they were irresponsible.

Your phone is really useful. It keeps you in contact with your friends and family, and keeps you from ever getting lost. You know that if there’s ever an emergency you’ll be able to call for help. You feel secure being able to call Ubers and look up whether that restaurant is open right now and pay for things even if you forget your wallet.

Your phone is precious to you. You get massive separation anxiety when you’re away from it. You used to sometimes leave your house without your phone, but now you can’t imagine how you’d do that or why you’d want to.

You’re never truly off the clock. You can get notified about a work email any time, no matter where you are, and you’re a bad worker if you don’t respond to all your emails promptly, because everyone else does. You have to have Slack on your phone and tap it every few minutes so that your status is always Active, or else people will think you’re not working. Your work laptop is your home laptop, so you could always be working on that project you haven’t finished, even on the weekend, even at 2 AM.

You’re in a constant state of stress. There’s a dozen bad things happening in the world every day, and you hear about all of them immediately. The world you live in is rife with crime and genocide and scandal and political catastrophe. People are wrong on the internet constantly, and the world is falling apart, and if you don’t stay informed and up to date, that’s a moral failing. Your heartbeat is elevated and your breathing is shallow and you haven’t slept well in a year.

You’re not in control. On your day off, you open your laptop first thing in the morning, and suddenly it’s five hours later and you haven’t eaten anything or brushed your teeth, and you can’t even say what you were doing on your laptop, because it wasn’t anything in particular.

This isn’t how you would have chosen to live, if you had thought about it beforehand. If you had been given a choice.

But you weren’t.
